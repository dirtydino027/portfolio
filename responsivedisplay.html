                - for this project i reimagined the interface of a website that i noticed was unintuitive and unresponsive <br>
                - after assessing the usability issues of the website, i made low-fi wireframes of my new design ideas for 
                three different formats: desktop, tablet, and mobile. these designs addressed the usability issues present 
                in the original website <br>
                - i then created a style guide including the colors, buttons, and text for the final design, and used it to 
                create high-fi mockups for the final website in the same three formats <br>
                - finally, i coded the actual website, focusing on responsive and intuitive design <br>

                - incorporating responsiveness into website design is important to account for different size windows and devices <br>
                - unresponsive interfaces can be unintuitive and difficult to use <br>
                - prioritize simple, intuitive interaces just including the necessary information and links <br>
