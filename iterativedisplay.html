                - for this project i worked with a group of cs students to design an app interface for a startup 
                called Hedgehog, which focuses on using AI robots for mushroom farming <br>
                - we began by each sketching designs for three possible pages of the app to consider as many 
                different designs as we could <br>
                - we then settled on the designs we wanted, made a style guide, and created high-fi prototypes 
                of eight app pages using Figma <br>
                - once we had these initial prototypes, we participated in a studio where our designs were critiqued 
                by other cs students, and then inforporated this feedback into an updated set of 18 app page mockups <br>
                - lastly, we conducted user testing to see where and how users' eyes scanned the pages <br>

                - working in a group allows for more diverse design ideas and solutions to issues <br>
                - when designing for an organization that you aren't familiar with, it is important to learn 
                about their goals, priorities, vocabulary, etc. <br>
                - it can be difficult to make decisions and incorporate everyone's design ideas when working 
                in a group <br>
